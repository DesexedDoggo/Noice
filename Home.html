Hi! Welcome to Freakoid.

I recently opened a new Hand Woven section to the shop and listed some woven scarf wraps! Recently listed some gorgeous forest leafy scarves! And some useful shabby chic altered couture embellished aprons! I'm SO EXCITED to share these with you and the new embellished fairy tops! Listed more fairy tops! If you like an item that has sold, just send me a message and I will happily custom make a similar one for you. :) </div>

<div id="Intro3"> Purchase quickly before they get snapped up! Please keep in mind that postage has slowed down at the moment due to the current Covid situation. I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your patience. Love to you all. Kirsty. </div>

<div id="Intro4"> I will be listing lots of wonderful spooky Halloween items earlier this year, so that we have more time to prepare and buy things and receive them in good time before October for Halloween. I hope this helps you all. :) </div>


<div id="Intro5">All your items come rustically gift wrapped! </div>

<div id="Intro6">Recently created a new shop section~ Masquerade Masks! Perfect for a party! :) listed two red and green Ivy leaf ones and more black witchy hats, mystical blue and purple pieces..Shroom hats and cute little leafy lip balm holder necklaces! :) </div>

<div id="Intro7">I can reserve items for you! And do partial spit payments. I love custom orders! Ask away! Feel free to make me offers! As I'm clearing stock at the moment to make way for more new creations this year! </div>

<div id="Intro8">Items will be sent with Regular Post. Approximately 5-10 working days International. (But due to COVID may now take longer.</div>
	
<div id="Intro9">If you'd like Express post (approximately 6 working days) just ask before purchasing so I can change the postage cost accordingly. Thank you. (usually about $20 more, it depends on what country e.t.c.) (International Express post is usually $42 and upwards, so I always try to pay a little towards it for you. :) </div>

<div id="Intro10"> HUGE THANKYOU to all my customers!....Also recently added some wet felted and vein sewn leaves in my new 'Creative Craft Supplies' Section of my shop ... To inspire and help all you beautiful peeps in your own projects... Happy Crafting :) These leaves are so fun to work with! Feel free to ask for custom orders. </div>
